/* Design and implement a class called Flight that represents an airline flight. 
It should contain instance data that represents the airline name, flight number, 
and the flightâ€™s origin and destination cities. Define the Flight constructor to 
accept and initialize all instance data. Include getter and setter methods for all 
instance data. Include a toString method that returns a one-line description of the flight. 
Create a driver class calledFlightTest, whose main method instantiates and updates several 
Flight objects. */
